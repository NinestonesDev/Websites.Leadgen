## 1.1 What is Thymeleaf?

*Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments, capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and even plain text.*

The main goal of Thymeleaf is to provide an elegant and highly-maintainable way of creating templates. To achieve this, it builds on the concept of Natural Templates to inject its logic into template files in a way that doesn’t affect the template from being used as a design prototype. This improves communication of design and bridges the gap between design and development teams.

Thymeleaf has also been designed from the beginning with Web Standards in mind – especially HTML5 – allowing you to create fully validating templates if that is a need for you.

## 1.2 What kind of templates can Thymeleaf process?
Out-of-the-box, Thymeleaf allows you to process six kinds of templates, each of which is called a Template Mode:

- HTML
- XML
- TEXT
- JAVASCRIPT
- CSS
- RAW

There are two markup template modes (HTML and XML), three textual template modes (TEXT, JAVASCRIPT and CSS) and a no-op template mode (RAW).</span></p>
